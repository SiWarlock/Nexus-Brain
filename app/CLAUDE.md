# Nexus Brain `app/` — Build Guide

> **You're in `app/`.** This file plus root `CLAUDE.md` both load. The root file covers global project conventions + shared comm rules (track-prefix, escalation taxonomy, messaging budget); this file owns code-area conventions for the Tauri desktop app.

## Launch protocol

| Working on... | cwd | Loads |
|---|---|---|
| Planning / docs / commits | repo root (`project-brain/`) | root `CLAUDE.md` only |
| the Tauri desktop app code | `app/` | this `CLAUDE.md` + root |

<!-- For a multi-area project, add a row per additional code area. -->

If you find yourself fighting the wrong conventions, check your cwd.

## Session start/end protocol

**At session start:**
1. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (repo root) **by section, not whole** — `grep -n "^##" IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for offsets, then Read with offset/limit just "Currently in progress" + the active phase. (The file grows; never load it whole.)
2. Confirm with the user what feature this session is targeting.
3. Read the relevant section of `ARCHITECTURE.md` from the lookup table below.

**At session end** (only when the user explicitly says we're done):

1. **Implementer runs `/session-end`.** Implementer writes ONLY:
   - `app/` code files (the slice's implementation)
   - test files (the slice's tests)
   - dependency manifest / lockfile (deps the slice adds)
   - `docs/sessions/<NNN>-<date>-<topic>.md` (session doc, created at `/session-end` Step 5)

   **Implementer must NOT touch (all orchestrator territory).** *This list is the canonical statement
   of the territory rule — `/session-end`, the brief template, and the generated
   `scripts/guards/territory-guard.sh` PreToolUse hook (which mechanically enforces it in team mode)
   all point here.*
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   - `app/LESSONS.md`
   - `app/CLAUDE.md` (entire file — both the Cross-doc invariants table AND the Lessons logged index)
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - `docs/orchestrator-briefing.md` / `docs/tdd-brief-template.md` / `docs/briefs/` / `docs/runbooks/`
   - other top-level deliverable / design docs
   - `.gitignore` and root-level dotfiles (unless adding a new artifact to ignore, flagged at Step 9)

   At Step 10: **explicit `git add <path>` per slice file; never `git add -A`/`.`; never stage an orchestrator-territory file.** Changes to any orchestrator-territory file (a new cross-doc model, a lesson, an arch note) are **flagged at Step 9**, not edited here — the orchestrator writes them hot (root `CLAUDE.md` + the Step-9 matrix).

2. **Orchestrator runs `/orchestrate-end`** for round close-out + Carry-forward triage + round terminal commit + push.

## Lookup table — where to find canonical info

Don't paste these sections into the prompt. Grep the file:section, read only what you need. `/check-arch <topic>` dispatches off this table.

| Topic | File (relative to repo root) | Section |
|---|---|---|
| <subsystem A> | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | §X |
| <subsystem B> | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | §Y |
| Lessons logged (full prose) | `app/LESSONS.md` | by lesson # |

<!-- Starts near-empty. Add a row whenever a topic is looked up twice. -->

**Code intelligence & docs (when available):** prefer a code-intelligence MCP / docs MCP over grep+read loops — see root `CLAUDE.md` "Code intelligence & docs."

## Stack

<!-- ▼ EXAMPLE BLOCK [id=area-stack]: stack quick-reference for implementer sessions. Canonical stack lives in root CLAUDE.md + ARCHITECTURE.md; this is the cheat sheet. ▼ -->

- **Runtime:** Node 22 LTS + Rust (Tauri host)
- **Framework:** React 19 + Vite + Tauri 2.x
- **Validation:** Zod
- **Lint / types / tests:** oxlint / tsc --noEmit / Vitest

<!-- ▲ END EXAMPLE BLOCK [id=area-stack] ▲ -->

## Standard commands

```bash
# Install deps (run once; re-run when the manifest changes)
pnpm install

# Run the dev server (if applicable)
pnpm tauri dev

# Tests
pnpm test:run

# Quality
pnpm lint
pnpm format --check
pnpm typecheck

# Preflight (use before saying "done" with a feature)
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test:run
```

## TDD protocol

**Write the failing test first.** Applies to deterministic code — see the TDD posture in root `CLAUDE.md` for what is test-first vs. exempt.

**Commit per slice when practical.** Never bundle a safety-critical slice with anything else.

## Forbidden patterns

<!-- ▼ EXAMPLE BLOCK [id=forbidden-patterns]: forbidden patterns — 3-5 narrow, enforceable, domain-specific rules. Shape: "Don't <pattern X> because <reason / past incident>; use <alternative Y>." Test-pin them where possible. Starts small; accretes as lessons surface. ▼ -->

Do not:

1. **Write code without a failing test first** (for deterministic UI logic). Even one-line functions.
2. **Consume a sidecar/IPC payload without Zod-validating it at the boundary** — *parse, don't trust*; the UI must never assume the core's response shape. (Mirrors the core's Pydantic boundary discipline.)
3. **Expose the loopback per-launch token** to the page/DOM, logs, or a non-`127.0.0.1` origin — it's the one authn mechanism; treat it as a secret, enforce the Origin allowlist. (§14.)
4. **Render an answer without its provenance** — every answer surfaces evidence chips + the freshness/staleness banner; never show a citation the core flagged as not-`live` as if it were live. (§10/§15.)
5. **Use `any`** without an inline reason comment — prefer `unknown` + narrowing.

**Enforcement patterns (machine-readable — `/preflight` warn-greps the staged diff against these).**

```forbidden-patterns
# rule 5 (no bare any): : any\b
# rule 3 (no token to console): console\.(log|info|debug)\(.*token
```

<!-- ▲ END EXAMPLE BLOCK [id=forbidden-patterns] ▲ -->

## Cross-doc invariants — schema/docs mirroring

Several typed models in this codebase are **contracts** mirrored in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and indexed in the table below. The architecture doc is the canonical contract; the model is the executable enforcement. Drift produces silent disagreement.

**Authoring discipline (orchestrator owns this table).** The implementer never edits this table or `ARCHITECTURE.md` directly — it flags a field add/remove/rename at Step 9 as a `Cross-doc invariant change`; the orchestrator writes the row + the arch edit hot the same round (see root `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/orchestrator-briefing.md`). Commits stagger; the working tree stays aligned within the round.

| Model | `ARCHITECTURE.md` section | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| <model> | §X | <field summary> |

<!-- Starts empty (or with the first model if one exists). Populated as contract models land. -->

## Module organization

<!-- ▼ EXAMPLE BLOCK [id=module-layout]: module layout + layer dependency rule. Replace with the project's real directory tree and import-direction DAG. ▼ -->

```
app/
  src/          # React 19 + Vite frontend (chat · evidence chips · freshness banner · project mgmt)
  src-tauri/    # the thin Rust host (Tauri 2.x; bundles + supervises the Python core sidecar)
```

Layer dependency direction (top depends on bottom, never reverse):

```
src (UI components) → a typed sidecar client (loopback HTTP + token, Zod-validated) → the core's public API
```

The UI is a **client of the frozen core public API** (§15) — it never reaches into core internals. The Rust host owns sidecar lifecycle + the token; the WebView owns rendering. Enforce the boundary with a test where possible.

Cross-cutting layers can be imported from anywhere. Enforce the rule mechanically with a test where possible — the test *is* the spec for the rule.

<!-- ▲ END EXAMPLE BLOCK [id=module-layout] ▲ -->

## Subagents

See `.claude/agents/README.md` for the canonical inventory + integration points.

<!-- ▼ EXAMPLE BLOCK [id=area-subagent-candidates]: area-specific subagent candidates — list candidates that would earn their keep specifically in this area (e.g. an ABI/types syncer for a frontend area, a Pyth/feed verifier for a contracts area). Build only on real friction. ▼ -->

<!-- ▲ END EXAMPLE BLOCK [id=area-subagent-candidates] ▲ -->

## Lessons logged from prior sessions

The full prose for each lesson lives in `app/LESSONS.md`. This index is the compact orientation surface.

**Lesson numbers are stable IDs** — once assigned, they don't change. New lessons get the next sequential number. `/session-end` proposes additions when it detects them; the user approves before the entry is written and a row is added here.

Lessons start at §1.

| # | Date | Topic | Rule (one-liner) |
|--:|---|---|---|
| | | | |

<!-- Starts empty. Each row links to its `LESSONS.md` anchor. -->

<!-- Slash commands: see root CLAUDE.md "Slash commands available." Implementer pair: /session-start + /session-end. -->
